-latest colored video sai hand, fd_sai_colored_bg_2.mat and y_sai_colored_bg_2.mat
-for latest colored video, use myNeuralNetworkFunction_sai_allcolors3.m and/or myNeuralNetworkFunction_sai_color_2.m (which ever gives better result)
-myNeuralNetworkFunction_sai_color_2.m is trained on only [fd/Y]_sai_colored_bg_2.mat
-myNeuralNetworkFunction_sai_allcolors4.m latest sai test and train video samples(887 samples)
-myNeuralNetworkFunction_sai_allcolors5.m on overall sai hand samples (2599 samples)
-myNeuralNetworkFunction_sai_allcolors6.m on all sai hand samples excluding test video frames
-myNeuralNetworkFunction_sai_allcolors7.m on all sai hand samples, mono samples included
generateFD functions:
-for the latest colored sai hand, there is no wrist, so to avoid wrist cropping logic, use generateFDfromfilewithoutwristcrop.m/generateFD2.m
-for wrist cropping enabled, used generateFDfromfile.m/generateFD.m
